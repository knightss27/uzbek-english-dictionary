# Uzbek-English Dictionary

This site allows for Uzbek-English translation, and gives common grammatical forms for many Uzbek words.

This site is meant to continue [Herve-Guerin's Uzbek-Glossary](https://github.com/Herve-Guerin/uzbek-glossary), the source of which was helpfully uploaded to Github, despite the site itself no longer existing.

This site parses Guerin's existing HTML files into an accessible API, and provides fuzzy search capabilities to explore Uzbek-English translation.
